## INTRODUCTION
Lab Activity 1 is a proposal for how the different assignments throughout the course should be weighted in the gradebook. According to the class syllabus, there are:
* One large team project split into 6-7 "microprojects"
* MindTap Assignments consisting of 59 graded exercises/exams
* Weekly Discussions, Attendance, and Group Project Meetings/Documentation that fall under "Participation"

Jonathan Berrios of Group 4 proposes that the team project weigh 5% per "microproject" for a total weight of 30% or 35%, that the MindTap assignments weigh 1% each for a total weight of 59%, and that "Participation" collectively weigh the remainder (11% or 6% depending on the number of microprojects).
## ANALYSIS
A large portion of the class is all the microprojects assigned as group effort or the individual projects assigned in SAIL. As such, these assignments collectively should weigh at least 30% of the final grade.

On the other hand, MindTap assignments are the easiest of all assignments in the course because a student is free to retry them as many times as needed until 100% is achieved. Assigning 1% to each of those assignments for a total weight of 59% is an almost given passing grade for the course, which may or may not be seen as too generous.

Similary, arriving on time to every lecture, making sure to participate during the lecture, and using Teams to discuss group microprojects with partners are all basic expectations for each student. As basic expectations, they should not weigh a lot; therefore, having them be the remaining few percentage points seems fair.

Overall, keeping participation about 10% of the final grade is best, but perhaps increasing the weight of the final group project while decreasing the weight of the MindTap assignments will result in a more accurate final grade reflective of a student's efforts throughout the course.
## DESIGN
projectGrade = average grade of all microprojects

mindtapGrade = average grade of all mindtap exercises

participationGrade will be left to the professor's discretion (how active was the student in class discussions? how was his attendance? how adequately did he use Teams? etc.)

finalGrade = projectGrade * 0.3 + mindtapGrade * 0.6 + participationGrade * 0.1
## CONFIGURATION
Implementation of this plan into the final calculation of the gradebook will be up to Professor Adams, though testing of the algorithm can easily be done using a simple calculator and simulated assignment grades to gauge how well the proposed weight system would calculate the final grades for the course.
